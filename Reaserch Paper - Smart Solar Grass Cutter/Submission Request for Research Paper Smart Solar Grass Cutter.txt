Abstract: In today’s era, home decoration's integral part is the lawn. Manual grass cutting demands significant labor and time, often resulting in uneven grass height. To address these problems, it is crucial to develop an automated system capable of mowing the grass without human intervention. This proposed system implements a robot with a solar-powered mechanism and battery backup that can be charged by solar energy. The system drives a robot that works in both automatic and manual modes. A user has to select the initial starting point from which the grass cutting of the lawn is to be started. The robotic system then automatically decides the path by detecting obstacles with ultrasonic sensors. The navigation system then decides which direction to go further by internal logic. The system can also be operated using an Android phone application. The grass cutter uses a solar-based energy source to charge the battery, which is easier to use and more advantageous compared to other energy sources, especially gas-based power sources.

This research is highly relevant to your readers due to its innovative approach to sustainable and efficient lawn maintenance.

I confirm that this manuscript is original, unpublished, and not under review elsewhere. All authors have approved the submission.

Please let me know if any additional information is needed. I look forward to your response.

Thank you for considering our submission.
